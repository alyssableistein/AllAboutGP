<h1> Why You Should Adopt A Guinea Pig</h1>

  <ul>
	<li>When you adopt you're creating space in a rescue centre so you're effectively helping more animals than just the ones that you adopt.</li>
	<li>If you adopt a pair of guinea pigs then it's likely they will already have an established bond.</li>
	<li>Rescues will ensure that prospective pet owners are well aware to ensure that they are the right fit to meet the guinea pigâ€™s care needs. </li>
	<li>Guinea pigs are great pets for children and live long lives compared to hamsters.</li>
</ul>
